# ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Income Prediction with Logistic Regression  

## ðŸ”Ž Overview  
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a person earns **more than $50K per year** using the UCI Census Adult dataset.  
The focus was on achieving reliable classification while also exploring which demographic and work-related features most influence income levels.  

## ðŸ›  My Work  
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset (handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, standardized numeric features)  
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding for model compatibility  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Trained a **logistic regression model** with balanced class weights to handle class imbalance  
- Evaluated model performance using **accuracy and precision**  
- Interpreted feature importance to understand the drivers of income prediction  

## ðŸ“š Tools Used  
Python (Pandas, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebooks
