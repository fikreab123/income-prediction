ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Income Prediction with Logistic Regression  

**Overview:**  
I built a machine learning model to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year using demographic and work-related data from the UCI Census Adult dataset.  
The goal was to create a reliable model that classified income levels and explored which features had the most influence on predictions.

**My Work:**  
- Loaded and inspected the census dataset  
- Cleaned data by removing missing values and dropping unnecessary columns  
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding  
- Scaled numeric variables for model training  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Trained a logistic regression model with balanced class weights  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and precision metrics

**Tools:**  
Python (Pandas, scikit-learn), Jupyter Notebooks
